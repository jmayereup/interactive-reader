My Two Homes - This is how a long title looks.
---
My name is Malee. For most of my life, I lived in the countryside. It was always very peaceful. I loved waking up to the sound of birds instead of cars. The air was fresh and clean, far from the pollution of big cities.
When I finished university, I had to move to the city for my new job. Life here is exciting but so different. It's very convenient; I can walk to restaurants and take the Skytrain everywhere, so I don't have to worry about traffic. But it is also much more expensive. My apartment is small and costs more than my parents' entire house! Sometimes, the streets are so noisy and crowded that I miss the quiet, open spaces of home. I like the energy of the city, but I will always treasure the peaceful life of the countryside.
